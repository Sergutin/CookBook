## Technologies Used

  ### HTML
    I used HTML technology to create the user interface and design the visual layout of the web pages. HTML allowed me to structure the content, define headings, paragraphs, and lists, as well as incorporate images, links, and forms, thus enhancing the overall user experience.
    
  ### CSS
    I used CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) technology to enhance the visual presentation of the HTML elements. By applying CSS rules, I could control the fonts, colors, spacing, and overall styling of the web pages. This allowed me to create a cohesive and visually appealing design that complemented the content and improved the user interface.

  ### Python
    I used Python as the primary programming language to build the backend functionality and handle server-side operations.
  ### Django
    I utilized the Django framework to streamline web development tasks and expedite the creation of a robust and scalable web application. With Django, I could easily handle database operations, manage user authentication, and implement complex functionality, saving time and effort in the development process.
  ### Bootstrap 5
    To achieve a responsive and visually appealing front-end design. 
  ### Cloudinary
    I integrated Cloudinary, a cloud-based media management platform, to handle image uploads, storage, and manipulation.
  ### Heroku PostgreSQL
    I deployed and utilized Heroku PostgreSQL as the database management system.

  ### Fixed Bugs
    During bug testing, it was discovered that the .gitignore file was not created, resulting in sensitive information being uploaded to GitHub. To address this issue, I recreated the database on PostgreSQL, updated all credentials in the env.py file and in the Heroku project settings, including the values for DATABASE_URL, SECRET_KEY, and CLOUDINARY_URL.

    During HTML code testing, there were several errors:
